# Employee Holiday Booking System
A holiday booking system that allows for employees to submit holiday requests that can be accepted or declined by an admin using a desktop admin application. There are two employee applications that allows for users to login with their email and submit/view their holiday requests. Both of the employee applications dont directly connect to the databse; the employee web service handles the communication with the database.
